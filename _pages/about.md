I am a first-year PhD student in Economics at Vilnius University. I hold an MSc (Honours) in Econometrics from the University of Amsterdam and a BSc in Quantitative Economics from Vilnius University.

My research interests are in macroeconomics, international economics, political economy, and geoeconomics. My current work focuses on how economic agents adjust to geoeconomic fragmentation, including trade disruptions, sanctions, and shifts in global production networks.
